# memento-mori
This program takes the user's date of birth and displays a message about time
and mortality.

The average life expectancy in Europe and the USA is about 80 years. If you
want the program to calculate with a different life expectancy, change the 
constant *LIFE_EXPECTANCY*.

## Dependencies

The program requires Python 3.6+ and the module *dateutil*, which is not
included in the standard library and can be installed using *pip*:
`pip install python-dateutil`

## Web app

Using *Streamlit*, I created a web app based on this program. [Try it
here](https://memento-mori.streamlit.app/) or take a look at the
[repository](https://github.com/tmitzka2/memento-mori).

## About Memento mori

*Memento mori* is a Latin phrase that translates to "remember that you will
die." It is a reminder that death is inevitable, which is why we shouldn't take
life for granted. It's easy to forget this in everyday life.

For centuries, philosophers have contemplated death and its meaning for our
lives. You can find more information about "Memento mori" on
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori).

> It is not death that a man should fear, but rather he should fear never
> beginning to live.

*â€” Marcus Aurelius, Roman emperor and Stoic philosopher*
